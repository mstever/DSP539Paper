This project includes coding examining the size and count of wildfires in California between 2007-2018. Specifically, these fires are located in Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Local Responsibility Areas that were drafted and recommended by CAL FIRE. Wildfires were recorded in acres for both city and county perimemters. The averages for both size and coount were calculated at the county-level.
